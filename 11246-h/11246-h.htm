<h2>LORD GROSVENOR'S GALLERY, PARK LANE.</h2>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>[pg

<p>At the commencement of our Twelfth Volume, we took occasion to
allude to the public spirit of the Earl of Grosvenor, in our
description of his splendid mansion&mdash;Eaton Hall, near Chester.
We likewise adverted to his lordship's munificent patronage of the
Fine Arts, and to the erection of the Gallery which forms the
subject of the annexed Engraving.</p>
<p>The Gallery forms the western wing of Lord Grosvenor's spacious
town mansion in Park Lane. It is from the designs of Mr. Cundy, and
consists of a colonnade of the Corinthian order, raised upon a
plain joined stylobate. Over each column of the principal building
is an isolated statue with an attic behind them, after the manner
of the ancient building called by Palladio the Forum Trajan at
Rome. On the acroteria of the building are vases on a balustrade,
and between the columns is a series of blank windows with
balustraded balconies and triangular pediments, which Mr. Elmes
thinks are so introduced as to disfigure the other grand parts of
the design. Above these are sunk panels, with swags or garlands of
fruit and flowers. Mr. E. is likewise of opinion that, "but for the
stopped-up windows, and the overpowering and needless balustrade
over the heads of the statues, this building would rank among the
very first in the metropolis; even with these trifling drawbacks,
that can easily be remedied before the whole is completed, it is
grand, architectural, and altogether worthy of its noble
proprietor."</p>
<p>The reader need not be told that the above Gallery has been
erected for the reception of the superb Grosvenor collection, the
first effectual foundation of which was laid by the purchase of the
late Mr. Agar's pictures for 30,000 guineas, and it has since been
gradually enlarged until it has become one of the finest collection
in England. It is not confined to works of the old masters, but
embraces the best productions of some of the most celebrated modern
painters. The Earl of Grosvenor has, for some years, been in the
habit of admitting the public in the months of May and June, to
inspect his pictures, under certain restrictions.</p>
<p>The Picture Gallery is but a portion of the improvements
contemplated by Lord Grosvenor. The mansion, in the distance of the
Engraving is, we believe, to be rebuilt in a correspondent style
with the Gallery, and the whole when completed, will be one of the
most splendid establishments in the metropolis.</p>
<p>Indeed, the recent embellishment of several mansions in Park
Lane is already indicative of the improved taste of their
distinguished occupants. A few years since the Lane for the most
part consisted of unsightly brick fronts; but stone and plaster
encasements have given it the appearance of a new
neighbourhood.</p>

<h3>HENRY JENKINS.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>A table showing the various changes in his religion, which by
the statute were required of Henry Jenkins, of Ellerton-upon-Swale,
in the county of York, in compliance with the principle, that the
English Constitution is essentially identified with the religion of
the state, and making it his bounden duty (as that of every
subject) to conform to it. Henry Jenkins was born in 1501, and died
at the age of 169, in 1670. He consequently was required by law, to
adopt the following changes in his religious creed and
practice:&mdash;</p>

<p>Jenkins was buried at Bolton-upon-Swale. A handsome pyramid
marks his grave, as the oldest Englishman upon record, and in the
church is a monument to his memory, with the following inscription,
written by Dr. Thomas Chapman:&mdash;</p>

<h3>VENERATION OF CATS IN ANCIENT DAYS, AND VALUE OF KITTENS,
&amp;c.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>The cat was held in high veneration by the ancient Egyptians.
When a cat died in a house, the owner of the house shaved his
eye-brows; they carried the cats when dead into consecrated houses
to be embalmed, and interred them at Bubastis, a considerable city
of Lower Egypt. If any killed a cat, though by accident, he could
not escape death. Even in the present day they are treated with the
utmost care in that country, on account of their destroying the
rats and mice. They are trained in some of the Grecian islands to
attack and destroy serpents, with which those islands abound.</p>
<p>In the time of Howel Dha, <i>Howel the Good</i>, Prince of
Wales, who died in the year 948, laws were made both to preserve
and fix the prices of different animals; among which the cat was
included, as being at that early period of great importance, on
account of its scarcity and utility. The price of a kitten before
it could see, was fixed at one penny; till proof could be given of
its having caught a mouse, two-pence; after which it was rated at
four-pence, a great sum in those days, when the value of specie was
extremely high. It was likewise required, that the animal should be
perfect in its senses of hearing and seeing, should be a good
mouser, have its claws whole, and if a female, be a careful nurse.
If it failed in any of these qualifications, the seller was to
forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value. If any one should
steal or kill the cat that guarded the prince's granary, the
offender was to forfeit either a milch ewe, her fleece, and lamb,
or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by its tail,
(its head touching the floor) would form a heap high enough to
cover the tip of the tail. From these circumstances (says Pennant)
we may conclude that cats were not originally natives of these
islands, and from the great care taken to improve and preserve the
breed of this prolific creature, we may with propriety suppose that
they were but little known at that period.</p>
<p>When Mr. Baumgarten was at Damascus, he saw there a kind of
hospital for cats; the house in which they were kept was very
large, walled round, and was said to be quite full of them. On
inquiring into the origin of this singular institution, he was told
that Mahomet, when he once lived there, brought with him a cat,
which he kept in the sleeve of his gown, and carefully fed with his
own hands. His followers in this place, therefore, ever afterwards
paid a superstitious respect to these animals; and supported them
in this manner by public alms, which were very adequate to the
purpose. Browne, in his <i>History of Jamaica</i>, tells us, "A cat
is a very dainty dish among the negroes."</p>
<p>P.T.W.</p>

<h3>ST. DUNSTAN'S, FLEET STREET.</h3>
<h4><i>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>In your account of this church, in No. 388, I perceive you state
that the clock and figures were put up in 1761, whereas I find by
reference to works on this subject, that they were so placed in
1671.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>[pg
244]</span>
<p>There are many curious monuments in this church, and among
others, is the beautiful one to the memory of Sir Richard Hoare,
Knt. who was Lord Mayor of London in the memorable year 1745, at
which "alarming crisis," in the words of the inscription, "he
discharged the great trust reposed in him with honour and
integrity, to the approbation of his sovereign and the universal
satisfaction of his fellow citizens." He died in 1754, and was
buried in this church. The monument, which is of marble, consists
of a sarcophagus, above which is a cherub in the act of crowning a
beautiful bust of Sir Richard with a laurel wreath, above is a
shield of arms, within an orb ar. sa. a spread eagle of the first
bearing an escutcheon of pretence ar. a lion ppr. in chief in base
a chev. gu. charged with three escallop shells of the first,
impaling a saltire sa. between four crosses fitche of the same.
Crest, a griffin's head erased ar. An inscription on the base
informs us the monument was restored in 1820, at the expense of the
parish, "in testimony of their grateful sense of obligation to a
family whose eminent virtue and munificence it is intended to
perpetuate."</p>
<p>In the vestry of this church is preserved a finely executed
portrait of the "Virgin Queen," in stained glass; and there is also
another window consisting of the effigy of St. Matthias, but this
is not to be compared with the other for execution.</p>

<hr />
<h3>CONSTANTINOPLE.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>One of the finest buildings in Constantinople is a fountain in
an open square, near the seraglio gate; it is a place built and
maintained by the Grand Vizier, for the people to come and draw
water, who have it served out to them in great jugs by people who
are constantly in attendance to fill them; the jugs are chained to
the place, and stand in rows about four feet from the ground,
between gilt iron bars in front of the building. There are men
always ready inside to draw the water and fill the jugs, which till
people come are kept full; these men receive a yearly salary.</p>
<p>The houses are chiefly built of wood, and reach so far over the
top that in some of the streets it would be very possible to get
from the windows of one house to another across the street. By this
manner of building, any one who has seen the place will not wonder
at the frequent and fatal conflagrations there, for if once a fire
break out it must burn till it comes to some garden or large vacant
place to stop at. The Bussard is the most regular part of the city,
and has a number of parallel streets crossing one another, and
covered at the top with planks which keep out the rain and sun.
Here all the richest and finest goods in Constantinople are put out
to show, as a pattern or sample of the merchants' stock, for sale
in their warehouses at home. Every street has its particular trade,
so that there is no mixture of shops as in other capitals. One
street is occupied by goldsmiths, another by silk and brocade
merchants; grocers and tailors have also different streets to
themselves. The city is always shut up at ten at night, so that no
one can have entrance or get out after that time. Indeed there is
scarcely any one in the streets after dusk, for every one then goes
to rest, so that when daylight is gone no business can be
transacted; but the people are obliged to pray every night one hour
and a half after dark, when the priests go up into the towers of
the mosques, and in a loud voice call crowds to prayers in these
words:&mdash;"God is great; (three times) give testimony there is
but one God, yield yourselves to his mercy, and pray to him to
forgive your sins. God is great (three times more) there is no
other God but God."</p>

<h2>THE NOVELIST.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE BACHELOR'S REVENGE.</h3>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>Mr. Hardingham, or as some of his very intimate friends used to
call him, Jack Hardingham, lived in a dull looking house in
&mdash;&mdash; Square, his profession (the law) was dull, his fire
and fireside were dull; and as he sat by the former one dull
evening, in the dullest of all his dull humours, and of such the
lonely bachelor had many, he sighed, kicked his shins, and looked
into his books; but as that was like gazing upon a very ugly face,
he shut them again, and rang the bell. It was answered by a portly
dame, whose age might be about some four or five and forty, whose
complexion was fair, whose chubby cheeks were brilliantly rosy, and
whose black eyes were so vividly lustrous, that one might have
fancied the delicate cap-border near them, in danger from their
fire. Over her full-formed bust, she wore a clear, and
stiffly-starched <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name=
"page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> muslin habit-shirt of purest white, a
beautiful lace-edged ruff around her throat, over her ample
shoulders was thrown a fawn-coloured shawl, and she wore also, a
silver gray gown of the material called Norwich crape, with an
apron rivalling in whiteness cap, habit-shirt, and ruff. We are
particular in describing the costume of this fair creature, because
when <i>dress</i> is invariably the same, it has unity with
<i>person</i>; it is identified with its wearer, and our affections
even are caught and retained by it, in a manner of which few are
aware. On the exterior of the lady whom we have endeavoured to
portray, "housekeeper" was as indelibly stamped as the effigy of
our king on the coin of the realm; and in a most soft and
insinuating tone, she said, "Would you be pleased to want any
thing, sir?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Honeydew&mdash;go and ask if they can't let me have
De Vere."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Or the Chronicles of the Canongate."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Or Anne of Geierstein."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Or the Loves of the Poets."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Or, d'ye hear, hang it, tell Mr. Mason there are seven or eight
other new works, the names of which I have forgotten, and he must
recollect."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>
<p>"Stop, stop&mdash;don't be in such a hurry&mdash;tell him, he
has never ordered for me the Quarterly, as I desired&mdash;that I
want to see the United Service Journal, and Blackwood for the
month; and that if he chooses to charge four pence a night for his
new novels, I'll not read one of them."</p>
<p>"Of course, sir; I'll tell him, for 'tis a shame, a real shame,
for any body to <i>repose</i> on, as one may say, a gentleman like
yourself. Never fear, but I'll tell him."</p>
<p>The lady retired, the door closed, and Mr. Hardingham sighed, "A
worthy creature is Martha Honeydew." "Come in," cried the gentleman
in a most amiable tone, as he presently recognised his
housekeeper's tap at the parlour door, and with a curtsey she
entered.</p>
<p>"O law, law! Mr. Hardingham, sir&mdash;Mr. Mason says&mdash;but
I don't like to give you all his message, indeed I don't&mdash;Mr.
Mason says&mdash;but I hope you'll never send me on such an
<i>arrant</i> again&mdash;he says, sir&mdash;O but I'm sorry for
it, that I am&mdash;he says then, that the <i>Quarter</i> you
<i>ax'd</i> for, ar'n't come yet, and there's time enough for you
to read it in when it <i>do</i>; that the Blackwood and the
Officers' Magazine are <i>hout</i>; that you may go without your
new novels afore he'll let you have 'em <i>chaiper</i> than other
folks, (and there's a shocking shame, sir!) and as for the works
you mentioned, there's fifty new ones at least to choose from; but
he can't remember what you don't be pleased to recollect yourself.
Dear heart! to think of a gentleman like you, sir, being
<i>trated</i> thus; why, my blood <i>biled</i> within me; and I
wouldn't demean myself to bring back any thing for you from that
place; but I took the liberty, sir, to get you 'Damon and Dorinda,'
a sweet pretty thing, from another."</p>
<p>"Ah!" sighed the bachelor, "I see there's nobody in this world
cares for poor Jack Hardingham, but Martha Honeydew;" and he felt
sorry that his housekeeper had departed ere his lips had emitted
this grateful praise. Yes, Mr. Hardingham felt vexed he scarcely
knew why; and uncommonly discontented he knew not wherefore; but
had he troubled himself to analyze such feelings, he would have
discerned their origin to be solitude and idleness. Mrs. Honeydew
brought tea; she had buttered a couple of muffins superlatively
well; and making her master's fire burn exceedingly bright, placed
them on the cat before it, and a kettle, which immediately
commenced a delicate bravura, upon the glowing coals; then,
modestly waiting at the distance of a few paces from her master
until the water quite boiled, she fixed her brilliant eyes upon his
countenance with an expression <i>intended</i> to be
<i>piteous</i>.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Honeydew&mdash;Martha," said Hardingham in a low querulous
tone, "I fancy I'm going to have a fit of the gout, or a bilious
fever."</p>
<p>"<i>Fancy</i>, indeed, sir; why, I never saw you looking
haler."</p>
<p>"Ay, Ay, so much the worse; a fit of apoplexy then maybe."</p>
<p>"Lauk, lauk! sir; a fit of the blue devils more likely. How can
you talk so? A fit of <i>perplexity</i>! Dear, dear! how some men
do go on to be sure;" pouring the steaming water upon the tea.</p>
<p>"You are a kind comforter, Martha; nobody ever raises my spirits
like you. Get me my little leathern trunk."</p>
<p>"Why, then, that I won't;" getting it down from a closet-shelf
as she spoke. "I wish it was burnt with all my heart, that I do;
making you so <i>lammancholy</i> as it always <i>do</i>."</p>
<p>And well might this trunk make Mr. Hardingham melancholy, for it
was the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name=
"page246"></a>[pg 246]</span> receptacle of letters and little
gifts of a lady who had jilted him in early life; and upon whom he
had often vowed vengeance. She was yet unmarried;
but&mdash;no&mdash;her once devoted admirer was resolved to follow
the lady's advice, and place his "affections upon a worthier object
than Caroline Dalton;" and, thought he to himself, she shall at
last see that I have <i>found one</i>; nor shall wild Tom, my
graceless nephew, who lives upon my fortune, ever more touch one
penny of it. The postman rapped, and in a few minutes his
housekeeper appeared with many apologies for bringing to him her
own newspaper, but perhaps in it he might be able to find the names
of some of the new novels that he wished to have.</p>
<p>"Martha Honeydew," cried Hardingham with a smile, the first he
had sported that week, "I am, as you know, a man of but few words,
and straight-forward in my dealings; say that you can fancy me, and
I'll marry you tomorrow."</p>
<p>Mrs. Honeydew's reply will be surmised; Caroline Dalton saw who
was preferred before her, and the bachelor's revenge ruined wild
Tom; for Hardingham settled all his property upon his wife, and a
pretty life the amiable creature led him.</p>

<h2>STONE PILLARS AND CROSSES.</h2>
<h4><i>(For the Mirror.)</i></h4>
<p>It appears from the accounts of the earliest historians, that
single stones, or rude pillars were raised on various occasions, in
the most remote ages. Of these we have frequent notices in the Old
Testament, as of that raised by Jacob at Lug, afterwards named
Bethel; a pillar was also raised by him at the grave of Rachel. The
Gentiles set up pillars for idolatrous purposes. The Paphians
worshipped their Venus under the form of a white pyramid, and the
Brachmans the great God under the figure of a little column of
stone. Many large stones are found at this day in Wales and
Cornwall, which are supposed to have been raised by the Phoenicians
and Grecians, who frequently resorted thither for tin and other
metals.</p>
<p>In Ireland some of these large stones have crosses cut on them,
supposed to have been sculptured by Christians, out of compliance
with Druidical prejudices, that the converts from Paganism not
easily diverted from their reverence for these stones, might pay
them a kind of justifiable adoration, when thus appropriated to the
use of Christian memorials, by the sign of the Cross. Some signs of
adoration are at this day paid to such stones, in the Scottish
Western Isles; they are called <i>bowing stones</i>. In the Isle of
Barra there is one about seven feet high, and when the inhabitants
come near, they take a religious turn round it, according with
ancient Druidical custom.</p>
<p>Stones were raised also as memorials of <i>civil contracts</i>;
as by Jacob, in his contract with Laban, when the attendants of the
latter raised a heap, to signify their assent to the treaty. Those
conical, pyramidal, and cylindric stones, perpendicularly raised,
which are seen in the British Isles, were formerly introduced in
general, to ascertain the boundaries of districts. On these,
representations of the crucifixion were frequently cut, and the
name of crosses were given to the boundary stones in general,
though remaining without this symbol. Many instances might be given
of these termini. At High Cross, on the intersection of the Watling
Street and Foss Roman roads, there was formerly a pillar which
marked the limits of Warwickshire and Leicestershire&mdash;the
present column is of modern date; another distinguished the
boundaries of Asfordby and Frisby, in the latter county. One at
Crowland, in the county of Lincoln, the inscription on which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>[pg
247]</span> has caused considerable dispute amongst antiquarians,
has been much noticed. A famous one near Landoris, in Fifeshire,
placed, as Camden says, as a boundary between the districts of Fife
and Stathern, was also a place of sanctuary.</p>
<p>Stone pillars, or crosses were also raised to record remarkable
events; as where a battle had been fought, or over persons of
distinction slain therein. Crosses were likewise erected where any
particular instance of mercy had been shown by the Almighty, or
where any person had been murdered by robbers, or had met with a
violent death; where the corpse of any great person had rested on
its way to interment, as those splendid ones erected by Edward I.
in memory of his beloved Queen Elinor; often in churchyards, and in
early times at most places of public concourse; in market-places,
perhaps to repress all idea of undue gain or extortion; and at the
meeting of four roads.</p>
<p>Penances were often finished at crosses. Near Stafford stood one
called <i>Weeping Cross</i>, from its being a place designated for
the expiation of penances, which concluded with weeping and other
signs of contrition. A great number of sepulchral crosses were
erected in Great Britain and Ireland, soon after prayers for the
dead came into use, by the desire of individuals, at their places
of interment, to remind pious people to pray for their souls.</p>
<p>The ancient practice of consecrating Pagan antiquities to
religious purposes, has been continued to times comparatively
modern; thus, Pope Sixtus V. purified the Antonine column and that
of Trajan, dedicating them to St. Peter and St. Paul, whose
statues, of a colossal size, he placed on their summits. Succeeding
Popes followed these examples, dedicating ancient columns, pillars,
and obelisks to different Saints and Apostles.</p>

<h2>NOTES OF A READER.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE LONDON UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE, No. 1.</h3>
<p>It is seldom that we "turn critics;" but our very bile rises at
the ill-timed dedication of this work to the King, as the "first
fruits of the combined exertions of a few of your majesty's
subjects, educated within the GROSSLY misrepresented UNIVERSITY of
LONDON." It is quite unnecessary for us to explain <i>why</i> this
Dedication deserves the epithet we have chosen: it stands with the
signature of "the Proprietors," and we hope is not the act of the
editors; but for the credit of the University, the publishers, the
proprietors, and editors, we recommend their friends to cancel the
leaf bearing this very offensive inscription, whether they care or
not for the golden opinions of all sorts of people.</p>
<p>If the present Number be a fair sample of the <i>London
University Magazine</i>, we can promise the reader but little
amusement in our "Notes" from its pages. It may prove useful enough
to the students of the University, but it wofully lacks the
attractive features of a Magazine for the public; it may suit the
library-table, but not the "excellent coffee room," or the "retired
cigar room" of the University Hotel. "On a general Judgment&mdash;A
new System of communicating Scientific Information in a Tabular
form&mdash;On the Study of the Law and Medicine&mdash;On Apoplexy,"
and the general business of the University, are very grave matters
for little more than 100 pages. "On the Metamorphosis of Plants,"
by Goethe, is more attractive; but Magazine readers do not want the
lumber of law and medicine&mdash;the dry material of parchment, or
the blood and filth of the physiological chair. How different too,
is all this from the pleasantry and attic wit of "<i>The
Etonian</i>," into whose volumes we still dip with undiminished
gratification.</p>
<p>As we have enumerated the least attractive of the papers in the
London University Magazine, we ought also to run over the lighter
portions of its pages. These are "A young head, and, what is still
better, a young heart,"&mdash;discursive enough&mdash;"A Tale of
the Irish Rebellion&mdash;the Guerilla Bride, a Poem,"
beginning</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"It is a tale of Spain&mdash;Romantic Spain!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&mdash;and a Sketch of the Irish Exchequer Court. A description
of the University, with a Vignette view, and ground plan, is
perhaps, the most interesting of the whole Number; but as dramatic
critics sometimes say of a new performer, we had rather see him in
another character before we form an estimate of his
talents&mdash;so we wait for better things from the London
University Magazine.</p>

<h3>THE EDINBURGH JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE, No.
1.</h3>
<p>We expected much from the announcement of this work, and are not
disappointed in its first Number. It contains <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
original papers&mdash;scientific Reviews&mdash;geographical and
natural History Collections&mdash;and an abundance of scientific
intelligence&mdash;somewhat on the plan of Mr. Loudon's excellent
Magazines. We have not at present room for extract; but the Number
before us will furnish several interesting Notes for a portion of
our next publication. <i>A Tour in the Island of Jersey</i> is one
of the most amusing articles we have read for some time, and we
hope to abridge it for our columns.</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE FOREIGN REVIEW.</h3>
<p>The Eighth Number of this valuable Journal is just published,
and its table of contents is exceedingly attractive. Among these
are Phrenology&mdash;a characteristic article on Germany&mdash;the
French and Italian Drama&mdash;anecdotical papers on Napoleon and
General Jackson and the United States of America, and the History
of the Cid. Ours will be a pleasing task to "note" through this
Number.</p>

<h3>GAS LIGHTS.</h3>
<p>We have now been so long accustomed to this new light in the
streets, that, like all other terrene goods, we have almost become
insensible to its blessings. Yet let him who desires to know what
he owes to chemistry and "Old Murdoch," turn into any of the
streets still lighted with oil, and then come back to the nocturnal
day of the Strand or Pall Mall. The parish oil lamps were like
light-houses on the ocean; guides, not lights; the gas has become a
perpetual full moon; and it may assuredly be pronounced one of the
most splendid and valuable applications of chemistry. Why has not
old Murdoch his statue? He deserves it even better than his master;
for the master was well paid in solid pudding. In other days, that
statue would have equalled the Colossus at Rhodes, and the
demi-philosopher would have breathed flame like the Chimera; in the
fabulous ages before that, he would have come down to us a god, or
a demi-god, the rival of Prometheus, Hercules, and Atlas. Why not
cast him in Achillean brass, the rival of the great hero of
gunpowder and Waterloo, and make him breathe gas like the Dragon of
Wantley, to illuminate the triumphal arch. Ingrata Patria!</p>
<p>The new light! yes, much has been heard of its power and
influence; but what has the new light of all the preachers done for
the morality and order of London, compared to what has been
effected by this new light. Old Murdoch alone, has suppressed more
vice than the Suppression Society; and has been a greater police
officer into the bargain than old Colquhoun and Sir Richard Birnie
united. It is not only that men are afraid to be wicked when light
is looking at them, but they are ashamed also; the reformation is
applied to the right place. Where does vice resort? Where it can
hide; in darkness, says the preacher, because its deeds are deeds
of darkness. Seek it in Pudding-lane, and Dyot-street, and the
abysses of Westminster. Why was not this new light preached to them
long ago: twenty bushels of it would have been of more value than
as many chaldrons of sermons, and taking even the explosions of the
inspector into the bargain. But it is well, that this is at length
to be compulsory; since it is never too late. Thieves and rogues
are like moths in blankets: bring the sun to shine on them, and
they can neither live nor breed. Let the Duke of Wellington place a
gas-lamp at every door of these infernal abodes; and since they
cannot be smoked out, make their houses as much like glass, on the
principle of the old Roman, as we can compass. This is the remedy;
at least till common sense will condescend to the better expedient
of pulling down and laying open all these retreats of misery and
vice; the disgrace and the nuisance of London, and not less a
standing inhumanity to the poor themselves.&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>CAPE WINES.</h3>
<p>The commerce at the Cape is wine; and the vine has already
increased tenfold, since the colony became British. But
unfortunately more attention has been hitherto paid to quantity
than to quality, except on the farms which yield Constantia. The
latter have an eastern <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name=
"page249"></a>[pg 249]</span> exposure, and are sheltered from the
south-west, the only injurious blast. The soil being a deposit from
the neighbouring mountains, is light, but enriched by manure. The
subsoil, which is even more important, is still lighter, being
mixed with sand and broken stone; on the contrary, in Drachenstein,
where the chief vineyards are at present, the subsoil being clay,
the wine receives an unpleasant flavour, the idea of which is
inseparably associated with the very name of Cape wine. It is
unnecessary to enter into the subject of its manufacture. If the
subsoil be bad, so will the wine be. The vine does not require a
rich subsoil. In Italy, flags are laid to prevent the roots from
penetrating into clay; and in England, rubbish is thrown in to make
a subsoil that shall not be so rich as to produce leaves, instead
of fruit. It would be advantageous were premiums offered for wine
that had not been produced from clay of subsoil, but had been
reared in trellis, as requiring less labour than the standard, and
made on a pure and good system, instead of being mixed with Cape
brandy, or sulphuric acid, &amp;c. Notwithstanding all these
disadvantages, Cape wine is generally sold in England under the
names, and at the prices, of Madeira, Sherry, Teneriffe, Stem,
Pontac, and above all, Hock.&mdash;<i>Gill's Repository.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>A VIEW OF LONDON.</h3>
<p>The finest view in London is from the top of Whitehall Place,
looking towards the river; but then you must see it as I did, at
the same hour, and under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>It was about a fortnight since I beheld that memorable
spectacle. I was on my way home, having dined with a friend, who,
though not an habitual votary of Bacchus, occasionally sacrifices
to the god with intense and absorbing zeal. After dinner we
adjourned to the Opera, having only determined to renew at supper
our intimacy with certain flasks of Champagne, which lay in their
icy baths coolly expecting our return. We carried our determination
into effect to the fullest extent; and at half-past three o'clock
we parted, deeply impressed with a sense of each other's good
qualities, and with as keen and lively an appetite for the sublime
and beautiful as an X of Champagne<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> usually
imparts to its warm-hearted admirers. My way led me through
Whitehall, at least I found myself there, as "Charles," the
guardian of the night, was announcing the fourth hour. As my good
fortune would have it, I happened to look towards the river, and
never, while memory holds her seat, shall I forget the sight which
presented itself. Six distinct St. Pauls lifted themselves through
the cloudless morning air (so pure, that the smoke of a single
cigar would defile it: I extinguished mine in awe) towards the blue
transparent sky; nearer, and beneath this stately city of temples,
were four Waterloo Bridges, piling their long arcades in graceful
and harmonious regularity one above the other, with the chaste and
lofty symmetry of a mighty aqueduct; while far away, in the dim
distance, a dome of gigantic dimensions was faintly visible, as if
presiding over the scene, linking shadow and substance, uniting the
material with the intellectual world, like the realization of a
grand architectural dream. Talk not to me of the Eternal
City&mdash;in her proudest days of imperial magnificence she could
not furnish such a view&mdash;thrice be that Champagne
lauded!&mdash;<i>Monthly Magazine.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>NEW YORK.</h3>
<p>The distant view of New York, almost free from smoke, is
singularly bright and lively; in some respects it refreshes a
recollection of the sea-bound cities of the Mediterranean. The
lower parts of the interior, next to the warehouses, resemble
Liverpool; but the boast of the city is Broadway, a street that,
for extent and beauty, the Trongate of Glasgow, which it somewhat
resembles in general effect, alone excels. The style of the
Trongate is, if the expression may be used, of a more massy and
magnificent character, but there is a lightness in that of Broadway
which most people will prefer. Those who compare the latter with
Oxford-street, in London, do it injustice; for, although the shops
in Oxford-street display a richer show of merchandize, the
buildings are neither of equal consequence nor magnitude.
Regent-street in London, is of course always excepted from
comparisons of this kind.</p>
<p>The portico of the Bowery Theatre is immeasurably the finest
<i>mor&ccedil;eau</i> of architecture in the city. It resembles
that of Covent-Garden, but seems to be nobler and greater; and yet
I am not sure if, in point of dimensions, it is larger, or so large
as that of Covent-Garden. The only objection to it&mdash;and my
objection is stronger against the <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page250" name="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span> London
theatre&mdash;is the unfitness. In both cases, the style and order
are of the gravest Templar character, more appropriate to the
tribunals of criminal justice, than to the haunts of Cytherea and
the Muses.&mdash;<i>New Monthly Mag.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>THE TRUE FORNARINA.</h3>
<p>The account of a journey which was taken in the year 1664, by
Cosmo, the son of Ferdinand II. de Medici, was written at the time,
by Philip Pizzichi, his travelling chaplain. This work was
published for the first time at Florence, about seven months ago.
It contains some curious notices of persons and things, and among
them, what will interest every lover of the fine arts. It is
this&mdash;speaking of Verona, he mentions the Curtoni gallery of
paintings, and says, "The picture most worthy of attention is the
lady of Raffaello, so carefully finished by himself, and so well
preserved that it surpasses every other." The editor of these
travels has satisfactorily shown that Raffaelo's lady here
described is the true Fornarina; so that of the three likenesses of
her said to be executed by this eminent artist, the genuine one is
the Veronese, belonging to the Curtoni gallery, now in the
possession of a lady Cavellini Brenzoni, who obtained it by
inheritance.&mdash;<i>Monthly Magazine.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>ITALIAN SCENERY.</h3>
<p>Happy is the man, who, leaving the Alps behind him, has the
plains of Lombardy on his right hand and on his left, the Apennines
in view, and Florence as the city towards which he directs his
steps. His way is through a country where corn grows under groves
of fruit trees, whose tops are woven into green arcades by
thickly-clustering garlands of vines; the dark masses of foliage
and verdure which every where appear, melt insensibly, as he
advances, into a succession of shady bowers that invite him to
their depths; the scenery is monotonous, and yet ever various from
the richness of its sylvan beauty, possessing all the softness of
forest glades without their gloom. Towards Bologna, the landscape
roughens into hills, which grow into Apennines, but Arcadia still
breathes from slopes and lawns of tender green, which take their
rise in the low stream-watered valleys, and extend up the steep
ascent till met midway by the lofty chestnut groves which pale them
in. To these gentler features succeeds the passage of the
Apennines, which here, at least, are not as the author of "Italy as
it Is," describes them, "the children of the Alps&mdash;smiling and
gentle and happy as children should be," but, as we remember them,
their summits form themselves into a wild, dreary region, sown with
sterile mountain-tops, and torn to pieces by wind and storm; the
only glimpse of peace is derived from the view on either side of
the sea, which sometimes shows itself on the horizon, a misty line,
half silver, half ether. This barren wilderness again softens into
gracefully-swelling hills turned towards Florence. The fair olive
tree and the dark cypress mingle their foliage with the luxuriant
chestnut boughs, and the frequent marble villa flashes a white
gleam from amid its surrounding laurel bowers. The sky is more
beautiful than earth, and each symbolize peace and serene
enjoyment.&mdash;<i>Westminster Review.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>MUSICAL MARVEL.</h3>
<p>One of the most amusing stories in ancient history, of the
successful and happy use of fine music, is told of Arion, who, when
about to be thrown overboard by some mutinous sailors, begged leave
to sing to his lute one funeral strain before his death. Having
obtained leave, he stood upon the prow with his instrument, chanted
with a loud voice his sweetest elegy, and then threw himself into
the sea. A dolphin, as the story goes, charmed with his music, swam
to him while floating on the waves, bore him on his back, and
carried him safely to Cape Taenarus, in Sparta, from whence he went
to Corinth. It would have been well for the mutineers if their
taste for music had been as great as the dolphin's, for the history
not only affords a grand instance of the power of music, but of
retributive justice, as the sailors accidentally going to Corinth,
paid the penalty of their evil intentions with their lives.</p>
<hr />
<h3>POPULATION OF AUSTRALIA.</h3>
<p>Mr. Martin mentions a very curious fact. The increase of
population, he says, has been most rapid, and is to be accounted
for by the number of females born, the proportion being, with
regard to males, as three to one! The great preponderating number
of females brought forth among domesticated animals, will account
for the countless herds of cattle which overspread the
colony.&mdash;<i>New Monthly Magazine.</i></p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>THE BLACK LADY OF ALTEN&Ouml;TTING.</h3>
<p>With the exception of the shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne,
there exists throughout Germany no spot of greater sanctity, no
altar of richer endowments, than the Chapel of the Black Lady, on
the frontier of Bavaria. The hearts of its sovereign electors have
been deposited, from century to century, within the consecrated
cells; nor is there an historic event, involving the interests of
their own, or the adjacent kingdoms, which is not supposed to have
been influenced by her potent interposition. A sufficient history,
in fact, of the destinies of the whole empire, might be recorded in
a mere catalogue of the national offerings to the shrine of
Alten&ouml;tting.</p>
<p>In rambling through the eastern provinces of Bavaria, some few
springs ago, I chanced to arrive one glowing afternoon at the
post-house of an inconsiderable town; which, from the grass-grown
tranquillity of its streets, and from a peculiar air of
self-oblivion, appeared to be basking fast asleep in the sunshine.
There was little to admire in the common-place character of its
site, or the narrow meanness of its distribution; yet there was
something peculiar in its look of dreamy non-identity; and had it
not been for the smiling faces of the fair-haired Bavarian girls,
who were to be seen glancing here and there, with their embroidered
purple bodices and coifs, and silver-chained stomachers, I could
believe myself to have reached some enchanted realm of
forgetfulness.</p>
<p>As I entered the Platz, or market-square, of the little town,
chiefly with a view to the nearer inspection of the cunning
workmanship of the aforesaid carcanets of silver, a light
sprinkling of April rain began to moisten the pavement&mdash;one of
those unheard, unseen, revivifying showers, which weep the earth
into freshness, and the buds into maturity. I was anxious, however,
to withdraw my mere human nature from participation in these
herbaceous advantages; and looking about for some shelter which
might preserve me from the mischiefs of the shower, without
depriving me of its refreshing fragrance, I espied in the centre of
the Platz&mdash;a square of no mighty area&mdash;a low,
rotunda-like building, with slated roof, overhanging and resting
upon wooden pillars, so as to form a sort of covered walk.</p>
<p>I settled with myself that this was the market-house of the
town, and hastened to besiege so desirable a city of refuge. But
during my rapid approach, I observed that the external walls of the
nameless edifice beneath the arcade were covered, and without a
single interstitial interval, by small pictures in oil-colours,
equal in size, and equal in demerit, and each and all representing
some calamitous crisis of human existence&mdash;a fire, a
ship-wreck, a boat-wreck, a battle, a leprosy! It occurred to me at
the same moment, that this gallery of mortal casualties and
afflictions must be a collection of votive offerings, and that the
seeming market-house was, probably, a shrine of especial sanctity.
And so it was!&mdash;the shrine of "The Black Lady of
Alten&ouml;tting."</p>
<p>Instigated by somewhat more than a traveller's vague curiosity,
I entered the chapel; the brilliancy of which, eternally
illuminated by the reflection of a profusion of silver lamps upon
the thousand precious objects which decorate the walls, forms a
startling contrast with the dim shadows of the external arcade. In
most cases, the entrance to a religious edifice impresses the mind
with a consciousness of vastness, and a sensation of
awe:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;the tombs</p>
<p>And monumental caves of death look cold,</p>
<p>And strike an aching dullness to the breast."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But the chapel of the Black Virgin is diminutive as a boudoir,
and yet retains the usual character of listening and awful
stillness, the ordinary impression of local sanctity. A few
peasants were seen kneeling in utter immobility and
self-abstraction beneath a lamp, which seemed to issue in a crimson
flame from a colossal two-fold silver heart, suspended from the
ceiling&mdash;their untutored minds were elevated into the belief
of a heavenly commune.</p>
<p>In a glass case above the altar, is deposited this far-famed
effigy of the Holy Galilean virgin&mdash;a hideous female negro,
carved in wood, and holding an infant Jesus in her arms of the same
hue and material; and exhibited in its extremity of ugliness by the
reflected glare of the silver and diamonds, and gems of every
description, by which she is surrounded. Chests, mimic altars,
models of ships, crowns and sceptres, chalices and crosses of gold
and silver and enamel, and enriched with</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Turkish blue and emerald green,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and every jewel of every land, lie amassed in gorgeous profusion
in the adjoining cases, and seemed to realize the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span> fabled
treasures of the preadamite Sultans. Boasting themselves as gifts
of gratitude or invocation from emperors and popes, kings, princes,
palsgraves, and all the other minor thrones and dominions of the
earth, these splendid offerings form the most plausible
illustration of the miraculous power attributed to the image of the
Black Lady, which has been deposited in its actual abode since the
year of Grace 696. In the course of the Thirty Years' War, this
important relic and its treasury were twice removed into the city
of Salzburg, for security from the Swedish invaders; and twice
brought back in solemn triumph to their ancient sanctuary.</p>
<p>But a mightier charm than that of gems or metals, the most
precious or the most beautiful, connects itself with the chapel of
Alten&ouml;tting&mdash;its association with historical names of all
ages, from Charlemagne and Otto of Wittelsbach, whose monuments we
find inscribed in Runic characters, to Pius the Sixth, whose
dedication, "O clemens, O pia Virgo Oettingana!" is graven in a
"fine Roman hand." It contains sepulchral vaults of the families of
Wallenstein, Tilly, Montecuculi, besides those of divers electors,
archbishops, and archdukes, whose titles speak far less stirringly
to the heart; altogether forming an illustration of the past, which
brings the dark ages in living majesty before our eyes.</p>
<p>Alternately dazzled and disgusted by this fruitless waste of
splendour, this still more fruitless waste of national credulity, I
was pondering over the domestic virtues of a certain "Franziska
Barbara, Countess of Tilly," as recorded over her grave, when the
chants of the priests, who had been engaged in the celebration of
mass before the altar, suddenly ceased; and, as the last fumes of
the incense circled upwards to the blackened roof, there arose
another and a solitary voice, evidently of lay intonation, and
deepened by that persuasive earnestness of devotion which, like an
electric chain, connects in holy feeling all sects of the Christian
church. It spoke in the fulness of gratitude, and in the humbleness
of prayer; and although the dialect was tinged with village
barbarism, and its thankfulness addressed to the Black Virgin, I
heard in its simple solemnity only the beauty of holiness; and,
overlooking the visible shrine, beheld in its ultimate object the
tribunal of divine mercy!</p>
<p>The devout speaker was one of a peasant family who had entered
the chapel unobserved, during my contemplation of its glittering
decorations. He was apparently a Bavarian farmer, somewhat advanced
in years, and wearing, in addition to his richly-substantial
holiday attire, a deep green shade over his eyes, which accounted
for the character of his thanksgivings to the miraculous image. "I
thank thee, O most benign and saintly Maria!" had been the tenour
of his prayer, "for the scattered and glorious gifts of Heaven,
which had become as vain things to my soul, till thy grace renewed
them in its knowledge. I thank thee for the summer skies and the
green pastures&mdash;for the footsteps which no longer crave a
helping hand&mdash;for the restored faces of my beloved
ones&mdash;and, above all, O holiest Virgin! I glorify thy name in
gratitude for the precious means by which the blessing of sight
hath been again vouchsafed me!"</p>
<p>This last mode of expression excited my curiosity, and when the
little group of votaries had concluded their ceremonies, had
affixed their consecrated tapers at the shrine, and deposited their
oblations with its officiating priests, I followed their joyful
footsteps out of the chapel, and was again struck by the delicious
transition from the heated and incense-laden atmosphere of its
interior, to the pure, balmy April air without, gushing with the
sweetness of the passing shower.</p>
<p>The ceremonies of the day were still far from their conclusion.
The historical painter of Alten&ouml;tting was in attendance in the
arcade, bearing the votive picture which was to perpetuate the
latest miracle of the Black Lady; and as far as I could observe or
ascertain of the sacerdotal hangman of the consecrated gallery, the
oldest and most weather-stained of the pictures was made to yield
precedence to the new comer. Having profited by a stranger's
privilege, and the English garb, which is held as sacred as a
herald's tabard in many a foreign land, to unite myself to the
little group, and address some casual inquiries to its frank and
overjoyous members&mdash;old Philipp Stroer himself, the hero of
the day, deigned to take the picture from the hands of the
sacristan, and to ciceronize for my especial edification. I trust
his restored vision was not yet sufficiently acute to admit of his
noting the smile which, in spite of my better will, stole over my
face, as I contemplated the phenomenon of bad taste, and worse
execution, which he thrust upon my observation. It represented his
worthy but very <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name=
"page253"></a>[pg 253]</span> unpicturesque self in the hands of an
oculist, and the endurance of a cataract. The eyes of his
surrounding family were fixed with eager interest upon the event of
the operation. "And what," said I, anxious to make some sympathy in
this domestic crisis&mdash;"and what is the name of the surgeon
whose efforts have been blessed by the protection of the Black
Lady?"</p>
<p>"The surgeon!"</p>
<p>"Yes; the oculist who is represented in the picture."</p>
<p>"That, sir, is no oculist, no surgeon; it is my Karl, sir, my
beloved son!" I shall never forget the voice, struggling with
emotion, in which the old man pronounced the words "<i>mein
sohn</i>!"</p>
<p>The story of that son was one of deep, though humble interest.
Trained in the agricultural habits of his forefathers, and destined
to succeed to the laborious honours of the Stroerische farm, young
Karl, to whom his gray-haired father was an object of the fondest
and most reverential affection, beheld with horror the gradual
advances of the disease which was about to render the remaining
years of life a burden to the sightless man. With the fractiousness
of advancing age and growing infirmity, old Philipp obstinately
refused to seek the assistance of any learned leech of the country
round. Brannau and Burchhausen boasted each of a chirurgic wonder,
but Stroer misdoubted or defied their skill. "His frail body," he
said, "was in the hands of a heavenly Providence, to which, as
might best beseem, he bequeathed its guidance." Meanwhile, the
perilous uncertainty of his footing, and the growing isolation of
his existence, became more and more perceptible, when one day, just
as an acknowledgement of "total eclipse" had fallen from his
quivering lips, the prop and stay of his household, his beloved son
Karl was missing from the farm! The first moment of uncertainty
touching his destinies was a trying one, but it was also brief. A
few days brought a letter from Munich, in which the absconded son
implored his father's forgiveness, forbearance, and patience,
during some ensuing months. Time, he wrote, might alone explain the
motives of duty which had caused his apparent error.</p>
<p>Patience is a difficult virtue to the sick and the unhappy. The
blind man, pining for his absent Karl, had need of all his trust in
the excellence of his favourite child: at times, misdoubtings
naturally arose; for the few months lengthened into seven,
eight&mdash;eleven&mdash;a whole year, and the wanderer came not
again.</p>
<p>At length, one autumn evening, a general shriek from the little
household apprized Philipp Stroer of some unwonted occurrence, and
straightway a voice demanded his blessing, and warm tears were wept
upon his hand, and he knew that his son was at his feet! The story
of Karl's absence was briefly and feelingly explained. Moved by his
father's obstinate aversion to place himself in the hands of a
strange practitioner, he had resolved to qualify himself for so
precious a charge; and having interested an eminent surgeon of
Munich by the detail of his affecting anxieties sufficiently to
insure his instructions in the single branch of surgery requisite
for his purpose, Karl had passed his days in infirmaries and
hospitals, denying himself the common sustenance of nature, in
order to maintain the respectability of garb necessary for his
admittance to the lectures of his scientific preceptor. At length,
his ardent endeavours were rewarded by a certificate of expertness;
and a patent of nobility would have afforded him a far less
gratifying excitement. Nor did Heaven withhold its blessing from a
cause thus hallowed by filial devotion; the operation, which
quickly followed his arrival at the farm, was attended with perfect
success. For some days, indeed, the old man still maintained his
resistance; but when he was assured that Karl had preceded his
departure for Munich by a pilgrimage to Alten&ouml;tting, and that
the especial favour of the Black Lady had sanctified his
undertaking, he became more passive&mdash;the result was a perfect
restoration to sight.</p>
<p>"And where," I exclaimed, "is this excellent, this worthy Karl
of yours at present?"</p>
<p>"By your side," replied a chorus of voices; and following their
indication, I turned towards a young man of sturdy appearance, who
acknowledged my salute with prompt and open frankness. He wore the
common peasant costume of the country, and laughed away my honest
praises as a mere exaggeration. "I had nothing to fear from my
absence," said he, looking towards a very beautiful girl who stood
beside him, "for I was secure of the good faith of my Hannchen, and
I knew that the Black Lady would bless my enterprise!"</p>
<p>I could not presume to despise this strange union of
intelligence and bigotry; nay, so intimately is the remembrance of
the family of Stroer connected <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page254" name="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span> in my mind with that
of the miraculous idol, that I must acknowledge some sort of
lingering superstitious reverence towards the shrine of the Black
Virgin of Alten&ouml;tting.&mdash;<i>New Monthly Magazine.</i></p>

<h3>YOUTH OF MOZART.</h3>
<h4><i>Abridged from the Foreign Quarterly Review.</i></h4>
<p>When we bring into one view all the qualifications of Mozart as
a composer and practical musician, the result is astounding. The
same man, under the age of thirty-six, is at the head of dramatic,
sinfonia, and piano-forte music&mdash;is eminent in the church
style&mdash;and equally at his ease in every variety, from the
concerto to the country dance or baby song: he puts forth about 800
compositions, including masses, motetts, operas, and fragments of
various kinds; at the same time supporting himself by teaching and
giving public performances, at which he executes concertos on the
piano-forte, the violin, or the organ, or plays <i>extempore</i>.
But when we learn that the infant Mozart, at four years of age,
began to compose, and by an instinct perception of beauty to make
correct basses to melodies; and also that he became a great
performer on two instruments, without the usual labour of practice,
we cease to be surprised at the mechanical dexterity of his fingers
in after-life, when composition and other pursuits had engrossed
the time usually employed in preserving the power of execution.</p>
<p>The father of Mozart held the situation of Vice Kapell-meister
and violinist in the chapel of the archbishop of Salzburg. In the
service of this haughty and ignorant nobleman, (who appears to have
been a complete feudal tyrant, and to have represented all the
pride and insolence for which the then beggarly-princes of Germany
were remarkable), he was so ill paid, that notwithstanding his
utmost exertions as an instructor, it was with difficulty he
supported a wife and family. Anna Maria,<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> born
August 29, 1751, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born January 27,
1756, were the only two of seven children who survived. The sister
made such progress on the harpsichord, that in the first journeys
which the father took in order to display the talents of his
children, she divided the public attention with her brother.
Wolfgang, however, not only profited as a player, from the careful
instruction which both the children received from their parent, but
began then to exhibit the extraordinary precocity of his musical
mind; the minuets and other little movements which he composed from
the age of four to seven show a consistency of thought and a
symmetry of design which promised a maturity of the highest genius.
Of the first expedition of Leopold Mozart with his son and
daughter, in January, 1762, little account is preserved, further
than that they visited Munich, and played concertos on the
harpsichord before the royal family. In the following autumn,
(Wolfgang being then in his seventh year), the father proceeded in
the same company to Vienna; the journey was made by water, and the
family gave concerts at the principal towns they passed, as
occasion served. Leopold Mozart writes, "On Tuesday we arrived at
Ips, where two Minorites and a Benedictine who accompanied us said
mass,<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> during which our little Wolfgang
<i>tumbled about</i> upon the organ and played so well, that the
Franciscan fathers, who were just sitting down to dinner with some
guests, left the table, and ran with all their company into the
choir, where they were filled with wonder." A little before, he
says, "the children are as merry as when they were at home. The boy
is friendly with every body, but particularly with military
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>[pg
255]</span> officers, as though he had known them all his life. He
is the admiration of all." At the Court of Vienna the family was
received with great favour, the Emperor Francis I. being mightily
pleased with "the little magician," as he used playfully to call
young Mozart. "There is nothing wonderful," said the emperor one
day, joking with him, "in playing with all the fingers, but to play
with <i>one</i> finger and with the keys covered, would really be
surprising." Upon which the child instantly performed in this
manner with as much neatness and certainty as if he had long
practised it. The father writes, "you will scarcely believe me when
I tell you how graciously we have been received. The empress took
Wolfgang on her lap, and kissed him heartily."<a id="footnotetag5"
name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> It
was at this time that Mozart began to display the feeling of a
great artist; just before he commenced a concerto, seeing himself
surrounded by people of the Court, he asked the emperor&mdash;"is
not M. Wagenseil here? <i>he</i> understands these things."
Wagenseil was called forward to the harpsichord; "I am going to
play one of your concertos," said the boy, "will you turn over for
me?"</p>
<p>As yet Mozart had only played on keyed instruments, but on his
return to Salzburg he practised privately on a little violin which
he had purchased in Vienna, and, to the surprise of his father and
some friends who had met to play over some new trios, he performed
the second violin part, and then the first, with correctness,
though without method. His horror of the sound of the trumpet in
childhood, and the early passion he displayed for arithmetic, are
well known; to the last he was fond of figures, and was extremely
clever in making calculations; though very improvident in his
pecuniary affairs. The peculiar delicacy of Mozart's organization
is displayed in the fine sense of hearing which he evinced at a
tender age. Schachtner, a trumpeter, who used to visit his father,
had a violin that Wolfgang was fond of playing upon, which he used
to praise extremely for its soft tone, calling it the "<i>butter
fiddle</i>." On one occasion, as the boy was amusing himself on his
own little violin, he said to Schachtner, "if you have left your
violin tuned as it was when I last played upon it, it must be full
half-a-quarter of a note flatter than mine." Those present laughed
at a nicety of distinction, upon which the most critical ear could
hardly pronounce; but the father, who had many proofs of the
extraordinary memory and exquisite feeling of his son, sent for the
instrument, and it was found to be as the boy had said. Although he
daily gave fresh instances of his extraordinary endowments, he did
not become proud or conceited, but was always an amiable and
tractable child. The affection and sweetness which characterize his
airs were inherent in his disposition, and the following anecdote
accounts for the prevalence of those delightful qualities in his
vein of melody:&mdash;"Mozart loved his parents, particularly his
father, so tenderly, that every night before going to bed he used
to sing a little air that he had composed on purpose, his father
having placed him standing in a chair, and singing the second to
him. During the singing he often kissed his father <i>on the top of
the nose</i>, (the epicurism of childish fondness), and as soon as
this solemnity was over, he was laid in bed, perfectly contented
and happy."</p>
<p>The young artist, in his eighth year, began to show a manly
intellect. It was in the third tour through Germany to Paris,
London. &amp;c. that the fame of Mozart extended throughout Europe;
but as many particulars of this period of his life are already
known, from the account published by Daines Barrington in the
Philosophical Transactions, the Letters of Baron Grimm, and other
sources, we shall only notice the newest and most interesting
incidents of this part of the Biography. From Wasserburg, Leopold
Mozart writes, "We went up to the organ to amuse ourselves, where I
explained the pedals to Wolfgang. He began instantly to make an
attempt with them, pushed back the stool and preluded standing,
treading the bass to his harmonies as if he had practised for
months." The violin-playing of Nardini, whom the party heard at
Ludwigsberg, is much praised by Leopold Mozart for the neatness of
the execution, and the beauty and equality of the tone. At
Frankfort, Wolfgang one morning on waking began to cry. His father
asked him the reason. He said he was so sorry at not being able to
see his friends Hagenaur, Wenzl, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page256" name="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span> Spitzeder, and Reibl.
Though the children performed before all the persons of distinction
they met on their route, yet as they were often rewarded with
costly presents, swords, snuff-boxes, trinkets, &amp;c. instead of
money, the father had much anxiety on this account. He says, in a
letter from Brussels, "At Aix we saw the Princess Amelia, sister to
the King of Prussia, but she has no money. If the kisses which she
gave my children, especially to Master Wolfgang, had been louis
d'ors, we might have rejoiced." In Paris, little Mozart performed
feats which would have done honour to an experienced Kapellmeister,
transposing at sight, into any key whatever, any airs which were
placed before him, writing the melody to a bass, or the bass to a
melody, with the utmost facility and without premeditation. His
deep acquaintance with harmony and modulation surprised every one,
and his organ-playing was particularly admired. A very pleasant
picture of the musical family was painted in Paris, of which an
engraving is given in the Biography. Mozart's sister relates, that
when they were at Versailles, Madame de Pompadour had her brother
placed upon a table, and that as he approached to salute her, she
turned away from him; upon which he said indignantly, "I wonder who
she is, that she will not kiss me&mdash;the empress has kissed me!"
At Versailles the whole court was present to hear the little boy of
eight years play upon the organ, and he was moreover treated by the
royal family with great distinction, particularly by the queen.
When she dined in public, young Mozart had the honour to stand near
her, to converse with her constantly, and now and then to receive
some delicacy from her hand. The father writes, "the queen speaks
as good German as we do. As, however, the king understands nothing
of it, the queen interprets all that our <i>heroic</i> Wolfgang
says."</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
